# Pull Request Preparation Summary

## Objective
Create a PR to `assafelovic/gpt-researcher/master` (the upstream original repo) containing our fork's master branch's `Dockerfile.fullstack`, `.github/workflows/docker-push.yml`, and `Dockerfile`.

## Files to Contribute

### 1. Dockerfile
**Key improvements from our fork:**
- Upgraded from Python 3.11.4-slim-bullseye to Python 3.13-slim-trixie
- Enhanced Chrome/Chromium installation with proper ARM64 support  
- Improved security with proper GPG key handling
- Added curl package for better networking support
- Enhanced build tools installation

### 2. Dockerfile.fullstack  
**Key improvements from our fork:**
- Updated to use Python 3.13-slim-trixie base image
- Enhanced multi-stage build process for better optimization
- Improved nginx configuration with proper proxy settings  
- Better supervisord configuration for service management
- Enhanced timeout and retry logic for package installations
- AIO (All-In-One) fullstack deployment support

### 3. .github/workflows/docker-push.yml
**Key improvements from our fork:**
- Updated workflow to build AIO fullstack images instead of MCP server
- Streamlined build matrix for better performance
- Enhanced Docker authentication with multiple fallback options
- Improved caching strategies for faster builds
- Multi-architecture support (amd64 and arm64)

## Next Steps to Create the PR

Since we cannot directly create a PR to an external repository through automation, the following manual steps are needed:

1. **Fork Management**: Ensure the th3w1zard1/gpt-researcher fork is up to date with these changes
2. **Branch Creation**: Create a new branch from the latest upstream master 
3. **File Updates**: Apply the three updated files to the new branch
4. **PR Creation**: Create a pull request from the fork to assafelovic/gpt-researcher

## Files Prepared
